import Underlining from "../../../src/styles/underlining"

I'm a software engineer with more than 3 years of experience in the world of web and mobile development.

I am passionate about solving real problems mediated by technology. I try to be in constant learning to improve my development practices and implementation of clean architectures, healthy for the user and the team involved.

In my free time I like to learn new topics that make me get out of my comfort zone and travel ✈️
